# ðŸ“Š Algorithmic Trading System with Kite Connect + Plotly Dash

## **Overview**

This project implements a fully automated real-time algorithmic trading system using the Zerodha Kite Connect API for live trade execution and Plotly Dash for dynamic monitoring.

It executes a 1-minute EMA 5/15 crossover strategy and logs trades + PnL live into Excel, while charting OHLC data, trade actions, and PnL in a Dash dashboard.
